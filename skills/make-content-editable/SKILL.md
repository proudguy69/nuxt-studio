## Goal

Produce a 1:1 visual match of every original rendered component, but with all content moved into MDC slots and props so it is editable in Nuxt Studio's TipTap editor. Running this skill must generate the exact same visual output as before.

---

## Step 0 — Select the markdown file and pick components to convert

### 0a — Pick the file

Glob for all markdown files in the project's content directory (try `content/**/*.md`, `content/**/*.mdoc`, `content/**/*.markdown`). Present the complete list to the user using `AskUserQuestion` (single-select) so they can pick exactly one file to work on.

### 0b — Pick the components

Read the chosen file in full. Extract **every component** referenced in it — both block components (`::component-name`) and inline components (`:component-name`). Deduplicate the list.

For each component, locate its Vue file (search `components/`, `app/components/`, and any project-specific component directories) and read it. Then present the full list to the user using `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true`, showing for each entry:
- The component name
- A one-line summary of whether it has hardcoded content or is already slot/prop-driven

### 0c — Confirm selection

After the user toggles their component choices, call `AskUserQuestion` again with a **single-select** confirmation question, e.g.:

> "Proceed with the N selected component(s)?"
> - Yes, convert them
> - Go back and change selection

This gives the user an explicit way to validate their choices before any conversion begins. If they choose to go back, repeat step 0b.

Then process each confirmed component one by one through Steps 1–5.

## Step 1 — Read and analyse the component

Read the component file in full. If any Nuxt UI components are already used inside it, call `mcp__nuxt-ui__get-component` (sections: `["theme"]`) and `mcp__nuxt-ui__get-component-metadata` to look up their slot API before continuing. For every element, classify it:

| Element type | Becomes |
|---|---|
| Hardcoded text (headings, paragraphs, badge labels, button labels) | Named slot |
| Repeated set of elements (list of cards, list of tabs) | Child component with its own slots |
| Icon name, URL/href, boolean flag | Inline prop `{key="value"}` or YAML frontmatter |
| Color / visual variant that differs between sibling instances | `color` prop with a static lookup map |
| Interactive UI logic (tab switching, accordions) | Hardcoded inside the component — not a slot |
| Code snippets shown in tabs | Named slot per tab (e.g. `#vue`, `#react`) |

**Naming slots from the HTML structure**

For each hardcoded text element, derive the slot name from its **semantic role in the rendered UI**, not from its HTML tag. Read the element, ask "what does this represent to an editor?", and pick the name from this table:

| HTML element | Semantic role | Slot name |
|---|---|---|
| Small label / badge / `<span>` above the heading | Eyebrow / category badge | `#headline` |
| `<h1>` / `<h2>` / `<h3>` — main section heading | Primary heading | `#title` |
| First `<p>` below the heading | Short summary / subheading | `#description` |
| Main content `<div>` — rich text, code, nested components | Body content | `#body` |
| Bottom area — CTAs, link list, secondary cards | Trailing content | `#footer` |
| `<a>` / `<button>` CTA group | Call-to-action buttons | `#links` (or prop `to`) |
| Tab pane named after a framework or topic | Pane content | `#vue`, `#react`, `#node` … |

Prefer these names because they match Nuxt UI's own slot API — editors and Studio users will recognise them. When a component contains a repeated item (e.g. a card), apply the same table scoped to that item component: the card heading → `#title`, the card paragraph → `#description`, the card body area → `#body`.

**Identify the visual render order top-to-bottom** — this is the required order of named slots in MDC.

**Check sibling instances carefully.** If a component renders a list of similar items (cards, features), read every instance. Colors, icons, and labels often differ between siblings — each difference becomes a prop.

**Optional — check for a Nuxt UI layout match (if the project uses Nuxt UI):**

If the project already depends on Nuxt UI, check whether one of its layout components already implements the visual pattern you're converting. If a match is found you can wrap it and forward slots through, rather than reimplementing the layout in plain HTML. Common matches:
- Badge + title + description + rich content area → `UPageHero`
- Feature/card grid inside a section → `UPageSection`
- Standalone card with icon/title/description → `UPageCard` or `UCard`

If no match is found, or if the project doesn't use Nuxt UI, build the component from scratch in plain HTML with Tailwind. See `references/nuxt-ui-components.md` for slot APIs and known quirks.

---

## Step 2 — Design the component tree

Map hardcoded sections to new components. Name them generically (reusable across pages, not tied to a specific page or content):

- One parent section component (e.g. `HomeHero`, `LandingFeatures`, `LandingSubHero`)
- One collection wrapper if there are repeated items (e.g. `FeatureList`, `LandingCards`)
- One item component for each repeated element (e.g. `FeatureCard`, `LandingCard`)
- One component per interactive sub-section with its own slots (e.g. `CodePlayground`, `LandingCodeExample`)

Define named slots using the semantic naming convention from Step 1. If wrapping a Nuxt UI component, align slot names 1:1 with its slot API (`#headline`, `#title`, `#description`, `#body`, `#footer`) so they can be forwarded directly without renaming.

---

## Step 3 — Create the Vue components

### Slot content vs props

- Editable text or rich content → `<slot name="..." mdc-unwrap="p" />`
  - Add `mdc-unwrap="p"` when the slot is inside a heading or `<p>` tag to strip the `<p>` MDC auto-wraps around block content
- Configuration (icon name, URL, boolean, color name) → `defineProps`
- Never use props for content editors need to change; never use slots for config

### Color / variant props

When sibling instances differ visually, add a `color` prop. Implement with a **static lookup map** — never build Tailwind classes dynamically (`bg-${color}-500` gets purged). Every class string must appear literally:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const props = defineProps<{
  color?: 'primary' | 'purple' | 'green'
}>()

const colorMap = {
  primary: { bg: 'bg-primary-500/10', text: 'text-primary-500' },
  purple:  { bg: 'bg-purple-500/10',  text: 'text-purple-500'  },
  green:   { bg: 'bg-green-500/10',   text: 'text-green-500'   },
}

const colors = computed(() => colorMap[props.color ?? 'primary'])
</script>
```

### Nuxt UI wrapping (only when a match was identified in Step 1)

- Pass every slot to the matching Nuxt UI slot: `<template #slotName><slot name="slotName" /></template>`
- Use `v-if="$slots.slotName"` for optional decorative slots (e.g. headline badge)
- Override inherited styles via `:ui` — do not add wrapper divs to reset styles
- Check the component's default styles and reset anything that differs from the original. For example, `UPageHero` in vertical orientation applies `text-center` to its wrapper, which cascades into the `body` and `footer` slots — always reset with `text-left` in `:ui` if the original didn't center that content:

```vue
:ui="{
  body:   'mx-auto max-w-4xl text-left',
  footer: 'mx-auto max-w-4xl text-left',
}"
```

### Interactive components (tabs, accordions)

- Keep the interactive logic (refs, computed) inside the component
- Expose one named slot per pane (`#vue`, `#react`, etc.)
- Use `v-show` (not `v-if`) to toggle panes so all slot content stays rendered

### Script tag

Only add `<script setup>` when there are props, refs, or computed values.

## Step 4 — Update the MDC in the markdown file

Replace each hardcoded component usage with the new MDC block.

### Slot order = visual DOM order

Slots must appear in MDC in the exact top-to-bottom order they render on screen. Studio presents editable regions in this sequence.

### Named text slots before slots containing nested components

Once a named slot is closed (by the next `#name` marker), the MDC parser cannot reopen it. Always declare plain-text slots (`#headline`, `#title`, `#description`) before slots that contain nested component blocks (`#body`, `#footer`). This prevents inner `#title`/`#description` markers from being misread as belonging to the outer component.

```mdc
::landing-sub-hero
#headline
Get Started in Seconds

#title
Simple to use, powerful features

#description
Install with npm and start parsing markdown in seconds

#body
  :::landing-code-example
  ...
  :::

#footer
  :::landing-cards
  ...
  :::
::
```

### Colon depth + indentation (both required)

- Top-level: `::name` — no indent
- Nested inside top-level: `:::name` — 2 spaces
- Nested one more level: `::::name` — 4 spaces
- Closing marker always matches the opening colon count
- Slot markers (`#title`, etc.) sit at the **same indentation** as their component opening
- Content lines match that same indentation

```mdc
::outer
  :::mid
    ::::deep
    #title        ← 4 spaces, same as ::::deep
    Content       ← 4 spaces
    #description  ← 4 spaces
    Content       ← 4 spaces
    ::::          ← 4 spaces
  :::             ← 2 spaces
::                ← 0 spaces
```

### `#default` for simple components, named slots for complex ones

The `#default` marker is valid and works well for components with a single content area. For simple wrappers, all three forms are equivalent:

```mdc
::simple-card
Content goes to the default slot.
::

::simple-card
#default
Content goes to the default slot.
::
```

Use distinct named slots (`#body`, `#footer`, `#content`) when the component contains nested child components that themselves have `#title` or `#description` slots. In that case, using `#default` at the outer level can cause MDC parse errors because the parser misreads inner `#title` markers as belonging to the outer component.

### Props in MDC

- Short config values → inline: `:::component{icon="i-lucide-zap" color="primary"}`
- Multiple or complex values → YAML frontmatter:

```mdc
:::component
---
icon: i-lucide-zap
to: /some/path
---
#title
Content
:::
```

### Code blocks inside slots

Content inside fenced code blocks is always treated as raw — MDC syntax inside a ` ``` ` block is never interpreted.

---

## Step 5 — Verify visual parity

After converting each component, compare every visual element against the original:

- [ ] Same section padding and container width
- [ ] Same heading text, size, weight
- [ ] Same description text and size
- [ ] Same badge/headline label and icon
- [ ] Same interactive controls (tabs, buttons) with same labels and icons
- [ ] Same code snippets verbatim
- [ ] Same number of cards/items, in the same order
- [ ] Same icon per card/item
- [ ] Same color per card/item (check ALL sibling instances — colors often differ)
- [ ] Same card title and description text
- [ ] Content sections (body, footer) not text-centered if the original wasn't

Fix any discrepancy before moving on to the next component.

## Step 6 — Update memory

After all components are converted, save any new patterns or edge cases to the project memory file.
